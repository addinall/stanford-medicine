## ABOUT THIS COURSE 
 
This course contains selected topics that will help you understand applications of molecular biology in medicine. We hope the course will bridge the gap between press reports and the medical literature. This is NOT a comprehensive survey, but rather a focused look at a few key topics:
Reading the primary literature, including how to read a paper and how to understand Kaplan-Meier curves 
 
*Molecular techniques*, including the polymerase chain reaction, gel electrophoresis of biological molecules, and genome editing by CRISPR technology
 
*DNA recombination*, including homologous recombination, V(D)J recombination, and retroviral integration
 
*Genome expression*, including how to measure and interpret gene expression profiles
The materials consist of videos, usually no longer than 10 minutes, each linked to questions that will help you evaluate your understanding. The videos were originally developed for Molecular Foundations of Medicine (Biochemistry 205), a course given to Stanford Medical School students in the first four weeks of their first year of medical school. Nevertheless, the materials were designed as stand-alone modules that benefit from a “chalk talk” format with diagrams drawn in real time.
